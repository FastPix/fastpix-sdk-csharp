## Overview

LIVE STREAMING API: The Live Stream APIs in FastPix simplifies the process of creating,managing, and distributing live content. This set of API endpoints is designed to help developers initiate live broadcasts, configure stream settings, and extend streams to external platforms (via simulcasting).
