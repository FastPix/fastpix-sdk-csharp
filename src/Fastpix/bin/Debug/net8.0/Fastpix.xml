            List the dimensions
            
            <remarks>
            Retrieves a list of dimensions that can be used as query parameters across various data endpoints. Each dimension has a unique id that can be used to filter data effectively. <br/>
            <br/>
            The dimensions retrieved from this endpoint can be used in conjunction with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list_video_views&quot;&gt;list video views&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list_by_top_content&quot;&gt;list by top content&lt;/a&gt; endpoints to filter results based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter views by `browser_name`, `os_name`, `device_type`, and more.<br/>

            <summary>
            List the filter values for a dimension
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint returns the filter values associated with a specific dimension, along with the total number of video views for each value. For example, it can list all `browser_name` (dimension) and show how many views occurred for all available browsers like Chrome, Safari (filter values). <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In order to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/custom-business-metadata&quot;&gt;Custom Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, you must enable them in the dashboard under settings option based on the plan you have opted for.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A developer wants to know how their video content performs across different browsers. By calling this endpoint for the `device_type` dimension, they can retrieve a breakdown of video views by each device (for example, Desktop, Mobile, Tablet). This data helps the developer understand where optimizations or troubleshooting is necessary.<br/>

            FASTPIX API&apos;S: FastPix provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable developers to manage both **on-demand media (video/audio)** and **live streaming experiences**, with built-in security features through **cryptographic signing keys**. These APIs cover the full lifecycle of content creation, management, distribution, playback, and secure access, making them ideal for building scalable video-first applications.<br/>
            
            <remarks>
            ### Media APIs (Video &amp; Audio on Demand)<br/>
            The **Media APIs** allow developers to create, retrieve, update, and delete media files, as well as manage metadata, playback settings, and additional tracks such as audio or subtitles. With these endpoints, developers can:<br/>
            - Upload videos directly or create media from URLs.   - Manage playback permissions and configure playback IDs.   - Add multilingual audio or subtitle tracks for global audiences.   - Build robust video-on-demand (VOD) and audio-on-demand (AOD) libraries.  <br/>
            **Use case scenarios**   - **Video-on-Demand Platforms:** Manage large content libraries for streaming services.   - **E-Learning Solutions:** Upload and organize lecture videos, metadata, and playback settings.   - **Multilingual Content Delivery:** Add multiple language tracks or subtitles to serve global users.  <br/>
            ### Live Stream APIs<br/>
            The **Live Stream APIs** simplify the process of creating, managing, and distributing live content. Developers can initiate broadcasts, configure stream settings, and extend streams to external platforms through simulcasting. These endpoints also support real-time interaction and customization of live events.<br/>
            - Start and manage live broadcasts programmatically.   - Control stream metadata, privacy, and playback options.   - Simulcast to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch.   - Update stream details and manage live playback IDs in real time.  <br/>
            **Use case scenarios**   - **Event Broadcasting:** Enable organizers to set up live streams for conferences, concerts, or webinars.   - **Creator Platforms:** Provide streamers with tools for broadcasting gameplay, tutorials, or vlogs with simulcasting support.   - **Corporate Streaming:** Deliver secure internal town halls or meetings with privacy and playback controls.  <br/>
            ### Video Data APIs<br/>
            The **Video Data APIs** Provide insights into viewer interactions, performance metrics, and playback errors to optimize content delivery and user experience.<br/>
            <br/>
             - Track video views, unique viewers, and engagement metrics<br/>
             - Identify top-performing content and usage patterns<br/>
             - Break down data by browser, device, or geography<br/>
             - Detect playback errors and performance issues<br/>
             - Enable data-driven content strategy decisions<br/>
            <br/>
             **Use case scenarios** <br/>
             - Analytics Dashboards: Monitor performance across content libraries<br/>
             - Quality Monitoring: Diagnose and resolve playback issues<br/>
             - Content Strategy Optimization: Identify high-value content<br/>
             - User Behavior Insights: Understand audience interactions<br/>
            <br/>
            ### Signing Keys<br/>
            FastPix also provides endpoints for managing **cryptographic signing keys**, which are essential for securely signing and verifying tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). These keys are critical for authenticating and authorizing API requests, as well as for protecting access to media assets.<br/>
            - **Private key:** Used to create digital signatures (kept secret).   - **Public key:** Used to verify digital signatures (shared for verification).  <br/>
            By rotating and managing signing keys regularly, developers can maintain strong security practices and prevent unauthorized access.  <br/>
            **Use case scenarios**   - **Token-based authentication:** Validate user access to premium or subscription-based content.   - **Key rotation:** Regularly rotate keys to reduce risk of compromise.   - **Protect intellectual property:** Prevent unauthorized distribution of valuable media assets.   - **Control usage:** Restrict access to specific users, groups, or contexts.   - **Prevent tampering:** Ensure requested assets have not been modified.   - **Time-bound access:** Enable signed URLs with expiration for controlled viewing windows.

            This endpoint allows developers or users to create a new video or audio media in FastPix using a publicly accessible URL. FastPix fetches the media from the provided URL, processes it, and stores it on the platform for use.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Public URL requirement:<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
              The provided URL must be publicly accessible and must point to a video stored in one of the following supported formats: .m4v, .ogv, .mpeg, .mov, .3gp, .f4v, .rm, .ts, .wtv, .avi, .mp4, .wmv, .webm, .mts, .vob, .mxf, asf, m2ts <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Supported storage types:<br/>
            <br/>
            The URL can originate from various cloud storage services or content delivery networks (CDNs) such as: <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            * **Amazon S3:** URLs from Amazon&apos;s Simple Storage Service. <br/>
            <br/>
            * **Google Cloud Storage:** URLs from Google Cloud&apos;s storage solution. <br/>
            <br/>
            * **Azure Blob Storage:** URLs from Microsoft&apos;s Azure storage. <br/>
            <br/>
            * **Public CDNs:** URLs from public content delivery networks that host video files. <br/>
            <br/>
            Upon successful creation, the API returns an `id` that must be retained for future operations related to this media. <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a POST request to this endpoint with the media URL (typically a video or audio file) and optional media settings. <br/>
            <br/>
            2. FastPix uploads the video from the provided URL to its storage. <br/>
            <br/>
            3. Receive a response containing the unique id for the newly created media item. <br/>
            <br/>
            4. Use the id in subsequent API calls, such as checking the status of the media with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get-media&quot;&gt;Get Media by ID&lt;/a&gt; endpoint to determine when the media is ready for playback. <br/>
            <br/>
            FastPix uses webhooks to tell your application about things that happen in the background, outside of the API regular request flow. For instance, after the media file is created (but not yet processed or encoded), FastPix sends a `POST` request to your specified webhook URL with the event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediacreated&quot;&gt;video.media.created&lt;/a&gt;. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After processing completes, monitor the events &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaready&quot;&gt;video.media.ready&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediafailed&quot;&gt;video.media.failed&lt;/a&gt; to track the status of the media file.<br/>

            Upload media from device
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint enables accelerated uploads of large media files directly from your local device to FastPix for processing and storage.<br/>
            <br/>
            &gt; **NOTE**<br/>
            &gt;<br/>
            &gt; This version now supports uploads with no file size limitations and offers faster uploads. The previous endpoint (which had a 500MB size limit) is now deprecated. You can find details in the <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/changelog/api-update-direct-upload-media-from-device">changelog</a>.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a POST request to this endpoint with optional media settings.  <br/>
            <br/>
            2. The response includes an `uploadId` and a signed `url` for direct video file upload.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Upload your video file to the provided url by making a PUT request. The API accepts the media file from your device and uploads it to the FastPix platform. (Refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/upload-videos-directly#step-3-initiate-the-upload&quot;&gt;Step 3: Initiate the upload&lt;/a&gt; for complete instructions.)<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            4. Once uploaded, the media undergoes processing and is assigned a unique ID for tracking. Retain this `uploadId` for any future operations related to this upload. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After uploading, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get-media&quot;&gt;Get Media by ID&lt;/a&gt; endpoint to check the status of the uploaded media asset and see if it has transitioned to a `Ready` status for playback. <br/>
            <br/>
            To notify your application about the status of this API request check for the webhooks for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/webhooks-collection#media-related-events&quot;&gt;media related events&lt;/a&gt;.  <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A social media platform allows users to upload video content directly from their phones or computers. This endpoint facilitates the upload process. For example, if you are developing a video-sharing app where users can upload short clips from their mobile devices, this endpoint enables them to select a video, upload it to the platform.<br/>

            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to extract named entities from an existing media.<br/>
            Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies and classifies key information (entities) in text into predefined categories. For instance:<br/>
            <br/>
              - Organizations (for example, &quot;Microsoft&quot;, &quot;United Nations&quot;)<br/>
              - Locations (for example, &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;Mount Everest&quot;)<br/>
              - Product names (for example, &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;Coca-Cola&quot;)<br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            1. Make a PATCH request to this endpoint, replacing `&lt;mediaId&gt;` with the ID of the media you want to extract named-entities.<br/>
            2. Include the `namedEntities` parameter in the request body to enable.<br/>
            3. Receive a response containing the updated media data, confirming the changes made.<br/>

            Generates a new playback ID for the live stream, allowing viewers to access the stream through this ID. The playback ID can be shared with viewers for direct access to the live broadcast. <br/>
            <br/>
              By calling this endpoint with the `streamId`, FastPix returns a unique `playbackId`, which can be used to stream the live content. <br/>
            <br/>
              #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
              A media platform needs to distribute a unique playback ID to users for an exclusive live concert. The platform can also embed the stream on various partner websites.

            Deletes a previously created playback ID for a live stream.This prevents new viewers from accessing the stream using the playback ID, while current viewers can continue watching for a short period before the connection ends. FastPix deletes the ID and ensures the new playback request fails.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            A streaming service wants to prevent new users from joining a live stream that is nearing its end. The host can delete the playback ID to ensure no one can join the stream or replay it once it ends.

            Retrieves details for an existing playback ID. When you provide the playbackId returned from a previous stream or playback creation request, FastPix returns the associated playback information, including the access policy.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            A developer needs to confirm the access policy of the playback ID to ensure whether the stream is public or private for viewers.

When you create a stream, FastPix generates a unique `streamKey` and `srtSecret` that you can use with broadcasting software such as OBS to connect to FastPix RTMPS or SRT servers. Use SRT for live streaming in unstable network conditions, as it provides error correction and encryption for a more reliable and secure broadcast.<br/>
            <br/>
            Leverage SRT for live streaming in environments with unstable networks, taking advantage of its error correction and encryption features for a resilient and secure broadcast. <br/>
            <br/>
            &lt;h4&gt;How it works&lt;/h4&gt; <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a `POST` request to this endpoint. You can configure the stream settings, including `metadata` (such as stream name and description), `reconnectWindow` (in case of disconnection), and privacy options (`public` or `private`). <br/>
            <br/>
            2. FastPix returns the stream details for both RTMPS and SRT configurations. These keys and IDs from the stream details are essential for connecting the broadcasting software to FastPix’s servers and transmitting the live stream to viewers.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. After the live stream is created, FastPix sends a `POST` request to your specified webhook endpoint with the event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/live-events#videolive_streamcreated&quot;&gt;video.live_stream.created&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Example:**<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
              Imagine a gaming platform that allows users to live stream gameplay directly from their dashboard. The API creates a new stream, provides the necessary stream key, and sets it to &quot;private&quot; so that only specific viewers can access it. <br/>

            This endpoint retrieves the current number of viewers watching a specific live stream, identified by its unique `streamId`.<br/>
            <br/>
            The viewer count is an **approximate value**, optimized for performance. It provides a near-real-time estimate of how many clients are actively watching the stream. This approach ensures high efficiency, especially when the stream is being watched at large scale across multiple devices or platforms.<br/>

            <br/>
              For an online concert platform, a trial stream was mistakenly made public. The event manager deletes the stream before the concert begins to avoid confusion among viewers. <br/>

            Complete a stream
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint marks a livestream as completed by stopping the active stream and transitioning its status to `idle`. It is typically used after a livestream session has ended.<br/>
            <br/>
            This operation only works when the stream is in the `active` state.<br/>
            <br/>
            Completing a stream can help finalize the session and trigger post-processing events like VOD generation.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A virtual event ends, and the system or host needs to close the livestream to prevent further streaming. This endpoint ensures the livestream status is changed from `active` to `idle`, indicating it&apos;s officially completed.<br/>

            Enable a stream
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to enable a livestream by transitioning its status from `disabled` to `idle`. After it is enabled, the stream becomes available and ready to accept an incoming broadcast from a streaming tool.<br/>
            <br/>
            Streams on the trial plan cannot be re-enabled if they are in the `disabled` state.<br/>
            <br/>
            The `livestreamId` must be provided in the path, and the stream must not already be in an enabled state (`idle`, `preparing`, or `active`).<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A creator disables a livestream to pause it temporarily. Later, they decide to continue the session. By calling this endpoint with the stream&apos;s ID, they can re-enable and restart the same livestream.<br/>

            Disable a stream
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint disables a livestream by setting its status to `disabled`. Use this to stop a livestream when it&apos;s no longer needed or must be taken offline intentionally.<br/>
            <br/>
            A disabled stream can later be re-enabled using the enable endpoint — however, if you&apos;re on a trial plan, re-enabling is not allowed once the stream is disabled.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A speaker finishes their live session and wants to prevent the stream from being mistakenly started again. By calling this endpoint, the stream is transitioned to a `disabled` state, ensuring it&apos;s permanently stopped (unless re-enabled on a paid plan).<br/>

            Get list of all media
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint returns a list of all media files uploaded to FastPix within a specific workspace. Each media entry contains data such as the media `id`, `createdAt`, `status`, `type` and more. It allows you to retrieve an overview of your media assets, making it easier to manage and review them. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            Use the access token and secret key related to the workspace in the request header. When called, the API provides a paginated response containing all the media items in that specific workspace. This is helpful for retrieving a large volume of media and managing content in bulk. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            If you manage a video platform and need to review all uploaded media in your library to ensure that outdated or low-quality content isn’t being served, you can use this endpoint to retrieve a complete list of media. You can then filter, sort, or update items as needed.<br/>

            <summary>
            Get a media by ID
            
            <remarks>
            By calling this endpoint, you can retrieve detailed information about a specific media item, including its current `status` and a `playbackId`. This is particularly useful for retrieving specific media details when managing large content libraries. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a GET request to this endpoint. Use the `&lt;mediaId&gt;` you received after uploading the media file.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. The response includes details about the media:<br/>
               - **status** – Indicates whether the media is still *Processing* or has transitioned to *Ready*.<br/>
               - **playbackId** – A unique identifier that allows you to stream the media once it is *Ready*.  <br/>
                 You can construct the stream URL as follows:  <br/>
                 `https://stream.fastpix.io/&lt;playbackId&gt;.m3u8`<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            If your platform provides users with a dashboard to manage uploaded content, a user might want to check whether a video has finished processing and is ready for playback. You can use the media ID to retrieve the information from FastPix and display it in the user’s dashboard.<br/>

            Delete a media by ID
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to permanently delete a a specific video or audio media file along with all associated data. If you wish to remove a media from FastPix storage, use this endpoint with the `mediaId` (either `uploadId` or `id`) received during the media&apos;s creation or upload. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a DELETE request to this endpoint. Replace `&lt;mediaId&gt;` with the `uploadId` or the `id` of the media you want to delete. <br/>
            <br/>
            2. This action is irreversible. Make sure you no longer need the media before proceeding. Once deleted, the media can’t be retrieved or played back. <br/>
            <br/>
            3. Monitor the following webhook event: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediadeleted&quot;&gt;video.media.deleted&lt;/a&gt;<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            A user on a video-sharing platform decides to remove an old video from their profile, or suppose you&apos;re running a content moderation system, and one of the videos uploaded by a user violates your platform&apos;s policies. Using this endpoint, the media is permanently deleted from your library, ensuring it&apos;s no longer accessible or viewable by other users.<br/>

            This endpoint allows you to add an audio or subtitle track to an existing media file using its `mediaId`. You need to provide the track `url` along with its `type` (audio or subtitle), `languageName` and `languageCode` in the request payload.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a POST request to this endpoint, replacing `{mediaId}` with the media ID (`uploadId` or `id`).<br/>
            <br/>
            2. Provide the necessary details in the request body.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Receive a response containing a unique track ID and the details of the newly added track.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Webhook events<br/>
            <br/>
            1. After successfully adding a track, your system must receive the webhook event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/transform-media-events#videomediatrackcreated&quot;&gt;video.media.track.created&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. Once the track is processed and ready, you must receive the webhook event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/transform-media-events#videomediatrackready&quot;&gt;video.media.track.ready&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Finally, an update event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaupdated&quot;&gt;video.media.updated&lt;/a&gt; must notify your system about the media&apos;s updated status.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            Suppose you have a video uploaded to the FastPix platform, and you want to add an Italian audio track to it. By calling this API, you can attach an external audio file (https://static.fastpix.io/music-1.mp3) to the media file. Similarly, if you need to add subtitles in different languages, you can specify type: `subtitle` with the corresponding subtitle `url`, `languageCode` and `languageName`.<br/>

            Suppose you have a video uploaded to the FastPix platform, and you want to allow users to download the video in MP4 format. By setting &quot;mp4Support&quot;: &quot;capped_4k&quot;, the system generates an MP4 rendition of the video up to 4K resolution, making it available for download through the stream URL(`https://stream.fastpix.io/{playbackId}/{capped-4k.mp4 | audio.m4a}`). If you want users to stream only the audio from the media file, you can set &quot;mp4Support&quot;: &quot;audioOnly&quot;. This provides an audio-only stream URL that allows users to listen to the media without video. By setting &quot;mp4Support&quot;: &quot;audioOnly,capped_4k&quot;, both options are enabled. Users can download the MP4 video and also stream just the audio version of the media. <br/>

             - The endpoint returns metadata for all unused upload URLs in your organization&apos;s library.<br/>
             - Results are paginated to manage large datasets effectively.<br/>
             - Signed URLs expire after 24 hours from creation.<br/>
             - Each entry includes full metadata about the unused upload.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            A video management team at a media organization regularly uploads content but often forgets to delete or use unused uploads. These unused uploads have signed URLs that expire after 24 hours and need to be managed efficiently. By using this API, the team can retrieve metadata for all unused uploads, identify expired signed URLs, and decide whether to regenerate URLs, reuse the uploads, or delete them.<br/>

            Get all clips of a media
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint retrieves a list of all media clips associated with a given source media ID. It helps you organize and manage media efficiently by providing metadata such as clip media IDs and other relevant details.<br/>
            <br/>
            A media clip is a segmented portion of an original media file (source media). Clips are often created for various purposes such as previews, highlights, or customized edits. This API allows you to fetch all such clips linked to a specific source media, making it easier to track and manage clips.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            - The endpoint returns metadata for all media clips associated with the given `mediaId`.<br/>
            - Results are paginated to efficiently handle large datasets.<br/>
            - Each entry includes detailed metadata such as media `id`, `duration`, and `status`.<br/>
            - Helps in organizing clips effectively by providing structured information.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            Imagine you’re managing a video editing platform where users upload full-length videos and create short clips for social media sharing. To keep track of all clips linked to a particular video, you call this API with the sourceMediaId. The response provides a list of all associated clips, allowing you to manage, edit, or repurpose them as needed.<br/>

            Enable video moderation
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint enables moderation features, such as NSFW and profanity filtering, to detect inappropriate content in existing media.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            1. Make a `PATCH` request to this endpoint, replacing `&lt;mediaId&gt;` with the ID of the media you want to update.<br/>
            2. Include the `moderation` object and provide the requried `type` parameter in the request body to specify the media type (for example, video/audio/av).<br/>
            4. The response contains the updated media data, confirming the changes made.<br/>
            <br/>
            You can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/ai-events#videomediaaimoderationready&quot;&gt;video.mediaAI.moderation.ready&lt;/a&gt; webhook event to track and notify about the detected moderation results.<br/>
            <br/>
            **Use case:** This is particularly useful when a user uploads a video and later decides to enable moderation detection without the need to re-upload it.<br/>
            <br/>

            Create a playback ID
            
            <remarks>
            You can create a new playback ID for a specific media asset. If you have already retrieved an existing `playbackId` using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get-media&quot;&gt;Get Media by ID&lt;/a&gt; endpoint for a media asset, you can use this endpoint to generate a new playback ID with a specified access policy. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you want to create a private playback ID for a media asset that already has a public playback ID, this endpoint also allows you to do so by specifying the desired access policy. <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Make a `POST` request to this endpoint, replacing `&lt;mediaId&gt;` with the `uploadId` or `id` of the media asset. <br/>
            <br/>
            2. Include the `accessPolicy` in the request body with `private` or `public` as the value. <br/>
            <br/>
            3. You receive a response containing the newly created playback ID with the specified access level.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            A video streaming service generates playback IDs for each media file when users request to view specific content. The video player then uses the playback ID to stream the video.<br/>

            **How it works:**<br/>
            1. Send a `GET` request to this endpoint with the target `mediaId`.<br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Make a `DELETE` request to this endpoint, replacing `&lt;mediaId&gt;` with the unique ID of the media asset from which you want to delete the playback ID. <br/>
            <br/>
            2. Include the `playbackId` you want to delete in the request body.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            <br/>
            Your platform offers limited-time access to premium content. When the subscription expires, you can revoke access to the content by deleting the associated playback ID, preventing users from streaming the video further.<br/>

            This endpoint updates domain-level restrictions for a specific playback ID associated with a media asset.<br/>
            It allows you to restrict playback to specific domains or block known unauthorized domains.<br/>
            <br/>
            **How it works:**<br/>
            1. Make a `PATCH` request to this endpoint with your desired domain access configuration.<br/>
            2. Set a default policy (`allow` or `deny`) and specify domain names in the `allow` or `deny` lists.<br/>
            3. This is commonly used to restrict video playback to your website or approved client domains.<br/>
            <br/>
            **Example:**<br/>
            A streaming service can allow playback only from `example.com` and deny all others by setting: `&quot;defaultPolicy&quot;: &quot;deny&quot;` and `&quot;allow&quot;: [&quot;example.com&quot;]`.<br/>

            This endpoint allows updating user-agent restrictions for a specific playback ID associated with a media asset. <br/>
            It can be used to allow or deny specific user-agents during playback request evaluation.<br/>
            <br/>
            **How it works:**<br/>
            1. Make a `PATCH` request to this endpoint with your desired user-agent access configuration.<br/>
            2. Specify a default policy (`allow` or `deny`) and provide specific `allow` or `deny` lists.<br/>
            3. Use this to restrict access to specific browsers, devices, or bots.<br/>
            <br/>
            **Example:**<br/>
            A developer may configure a playback ID to deny access from known scraping user-agents while allowing all others by default.<br/>

            Create a new playlist
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint creates a new playlist within a specified workspace. A playlist acts as a container for organizing media items either manually or based on filters and metadata. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>
            ### Playlists can be created in two modes<br/>
            - **Manual:** Creates an empty playlist without any initial media items. Use this mode for manual curation, where you add items later in a user-defined sequence.<br/>
            - **Smart:** Auto-populates the playlist at creation time based on the filter criteria (for example, a video creation date range) that you provide in the request.<br/>
            <br/>
            For more details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/create-and-manage-playlist&quot;&gt;Create and manage playlist&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works <br/>
            <br/>
             - When you send a `POST` request to this endpoint, FastPix creates a playlist and returns a playlist ID, using which items can be added later in a user-defined sequence.<br/>
             - You can create a smart playlist that is auto-populated based on the metadata in the request body.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            An e-learning platform creates a new playlist titled Beginner Python Series through the API. The response returns a unique playlist ID. The platform uses this ID to add a series of video tutorials to the playlist in a defined order. The playlist appears on the frontend as a structured learning path for learners.

            Create a signing key
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to create a new signing key pair for FastPix. When you call this endpoint, the API generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair. The privateKey is returned in the response, encoded in Base64 format. You also receive a unique key ID to reference the key in future operations. FastPix securely stores the public key to validate signed tokens. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &lt;h4&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt; <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Private key handling:** The privateKey you receive is encoded in Base64. To use it, decode the value using Base64 decoding. Make sure to store this private key securely, as it is required for signing tokens. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Key-ID:** The ID is used to reference this specific key pair in future API requests or configurations.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After the key pair is generated, the developer must securely store the private key because FastPix does not save it. The public key is used by FastPix to verify signed tokens and ensure that the client interacting with the system is legitimate.<br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Use case:** A developer building a video subscription service wants to ensure that only authorized users can access premium content. By generating a signing key, the developer can issue signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate and authorize users. These tokens can be validated by FastPix using the stored public key. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Detailed example:**  You are building a video-on-demand platform that restricts access based on user subscriptions. To ensure only subscribed users can stream content, you generate a signing key using this API. Each time a user logs in, you create a JWT signed with the private key. When the user attempts to play a video, FastPix uses the public key to verify the token and confirms that the user is authorized.&lt;br/&gt;<br/>

            This endpoint returns a list of all the signing keys associated with an organization in FastPix. Each key entry in the response includes metadata such as the key id, creation date, and workspace details. This helps you manage multiple keys, track their usage, and identify which keys are valid for signing API requests. <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            The API returns the list in a paginated format, allowing you to audit and track all keys used for your application. Regularly reviewing this list is essential for ensuring that old or compromised keys are promptly revoked and that new keys are properly integrated into workflows. <br/>

            <br/>
            **Use case:** A security-conscious development team wants to ensure they follow a key rotation policy, rotating signing keys every few months. By retrieving the list of signing keys, they can identify which keys are still in use and which ones need to be rotated. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Detailed example:**  You manage a multi-region video platform where teams in different regions use their own signing keys. To comply with your organization’s security policies, you regularly review the list of signing keys to verify which ones are still active. You notice that some keys haven’t been used for several months. Based on their creation dates, you decide to rotate those keys.

            Delete a signing key
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to delete an existing signing key, and the action is permanent. After a key is deleted, any signatures or tokens generated with that key become invalid immediately. This means you can no longer use the key to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or authenticate API requests. <br/>
            &lt;h4&gt;Usage&lt;/h4&gt; <br/>
            To delete a signing key, provide the unique key ID that you obtained when creating the key. This key id serves as the identifier for the specific signing key you want to remove from your account. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &lt;h4&gt;How it works&lt;/h4&gt; <br/>
            <br/>
            When you specify the keyId, the API removes the signing key from the system. After the key is deleted, any API requests or tokens that rely on it fail. This action is useful when a key is compromised or when rotating keys as part of security policies. <br/>

            **Use case:** A key used by an outdated application version has been compromised, or a developer accidentally leaked it. To prevent unauthorized access, the developer deletes the signing key, revoking its ability to sign requests immediately. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            **Detailed example:**  Suppose you have a signing key used for a specific version of your mobile app, and you discover that the key has been compromised due to a security breach. To mitigate the issue, you delete the key to invalidate any tokens generated using it. As soon as the key is deleted, users on the compromised version of the app can no longer make valid requests, thus preventing further exploitation.

            Get signing key by ID
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific signing key using its unique key id. While the private key is not returned for security reasons, You can view the key’s creation date, status, and other associated metadata. This endpoint also returns the workspaceId and publicKey in the response. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &lt;h4&gt;Usage: Generating a JWT token&lt;/h4&gt; <br/>
            <br/>
            In the response, the API returns the workspaceId and publicKey associated with the signing key. With the publicKey and the privateKey obtained from the &quot;Create a Signing Key&quot; endpoint, you can generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the RS256 algorithm. This token can be utilized for accessing private media assets, GIFs, thumbnails, and spritesheets. <br/>

            <summary>
            Create a simulcast
            
            <remarks>
            Creates a simulcast for a parent live stream. Simulcasting allows you to broadcast a live stream to multiple social platforms simultaneously (for example, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch). This helps expand your audience reach across platforms. A simulcast can only be created when the parent live stream is in the idle state (not currently live or disabled). Only one simulcast target can be created per API call. <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Change to: When you call this endpoint, provide the parent `streamId` along with the simulcast target details (such as platform and credentials). The API returns a unique `simulcastId`, which you can use to manage the simulcast later.  <br/>
            <br/>
            2. To notify your application about the status of simulcast related events check for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/webhooks-collection#simulcast-target-events&quot;&gt;webhooks for simulcast&lt;/a&gt; target events. <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            An event manager sets up a live stream for a virtual conference and wants to simulcast the stream on YouTube and Facebook Live. They first create the primary live stream in FastPix, ensuring it&apos;s in the idle state. Then, they use the API to create a simulcast target for YouTube. <br/>

            <remarks>
            Deletes a simulcast using its unique simulcastId, which you received during the simulcast creation process. Deleting a simulcast stops the broadcast to the associated platform, while the parent stream continues if it’s live. This action can’t be undone, and you must create a new simulcast to resume streaming to the same platform.<br/>

            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            A broadcaster may need to stop simulcasting to one platform while keeping the stream active on others. For example, a tech company is simulcasting a product launch across multiple platforms. Midway through the event, they decide to stop the simulcast on Facebook due to performance issues but continue streaming on YouTube. They use this API to delete the Facebook simulcast target.

            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            This endpoint can be used to verify the status of the simulcast on external platforms before the live stream begins. For example, before starting a live gaming event, the organizer wants to ensure that the simulcast to Twitch is set up correctly. They retrieve the simulcast information to confirm that everything is properly configured.

It’s useful for making changes to a stream that has already been created but not yet ended. After the live stream is disabled, you cannot update a stream. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
              The updated stream parameters and the `streamId` needs to be shared in the request, and FastPix returns the updated stream details.

            <br/>
             A host realizes they need to extend the reconnect window for their live stream in case they lose connection temporarily during the event. Or suppose during a multi-day online conference, the event organizers need to update the stream title to reflect the next day&quot;s session while keeping the same stream ID for continuity. <br/>

            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to delete an existing audio or subtitle track from a media file. Once deleted, the track must no longer be available for playback.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a DELETE request to this endpoint, replacing `{mediaId}` with the media ID, and `{trackId}` with the ID of the track you want to remove.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. The track gets deleted from the media file, and you must receive a confirmation response.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Webhook events<br/>
            <br/>
            1. After successfully deleting a track, your system must receive the webhook event **video.media.track.deleted**.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. Once the media file is updated to reflect the track removal, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaupdated&quot;&gt;video.media.updated&lt;/a&gt; event must be triggered.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            Suppose you uploaded an audio track in Italian for a video but later realize it&apos;s incorrect or no longer needed. By calling this API, you can remove the specific track while keeping the rest of the media file unchanged. This is useful when:<br/>
            <br/>
              - A track was mistakenly added and needs to be removed.<br/>
              - The content owner requests the removal of a specific subtitle or audio track.<br/>
              - A new version of the track gets uploaded to replace the existing one.<br/>

            Retrieves a list of all media clips generated from a specific livestream. Each media entry includes metadata such as the clip media IDs, and other relevant details. A media clip is a segmented portion of an original media file (source live stream). Clips are often created for various purposes such as previews, highlights, or customized edits.<br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            1. Provide the livestreamId as a parameter when calling this endpoint.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. The API returns a paginated list of media clips created from the specified livestream.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Pagination helps maintain performance and usability when handling large sets of media files, making it easier to organize and manage content in bulk.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Use case<br/>
            Suppose you’re hosting a live gaming event and want to showcase key moments from the stream — such as top plays or final match highlights. You can use this endpoint to fetch all clips generated from that livestream, display them in your dashboard, or use them for post-event editing and sharing.<br/>

            If a user uploads a video and later needs to change the title, add a new description, or update tags, you can use this endpoint to update the media metadata without re-uploading the entire video.<br/>

            <summary>
            Update audio / subtitle track
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint allows you to update an existing audio or subtitle track associated with a media file. When updating a track, you must provide the new track `url`, `languageName`, and `languageCode`, ensuring all three parameters are included in the request.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            1. Send a PATCH request to this endpoint, replacing `{mediaId}` with the media ID, and `{trackId}` with the ID of the track you want to update.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. Provide the necessary details in the request body.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Receive a response confirming the track update.<br/>
            <br/>
            #### Webhook Events<br/>
            <br/>
            After updating a track, your system must receive webhook notifications:<br/>
            <br/>
            1. After successfully updating a track, your system must receive the webhook event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/transform-media-events#videomediatrackupdated&quot;&gt;video.media.track.updated&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            2. Once the new track is processed and ready, you must receive the webhook event &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/transform-media-events#videomediatrackready&quot;&gt;video.media.track.ready&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>
            <br/>
            3. Once the media file is updated with the new track details, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaupdated&quot;&gt;video.media.updated&lt;/a&gt; event must be triggered.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
            Suppose you previously added a French subtitle track to a video but now need to update it with a different file. By calling this API, you can replace the existing subtitle file (.vtt) with a new one while keeping the same track ID. This is useful when:<br/>
            <br/>
              - The original track file has errors and needs correction.<br/>
              - You want to improve subtitle translations or replace an audio track with a better-quality version.<br/>

            <summary>
            Get the summary of a video
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint returns the generated summary of a video.  <br/>
            <br/>
            The summary is created using the **InVideo Summary** feature, which processes the video content and produces a textual summary.  <br/>
            <br/>
            To use this endpoint, you must first generate the video summary using the Generate Video Summary endpoint. This endpoint can return the summary only after that process is complete. <br/>
            <br/>
            Typical use cases include:  <br/>
            - Providing viewers with a quick preview of the video&apos;s main content.  <br/>
            - Enabling search or recommendation systems to surface summarized insights.  <br/>
            - Supporting accessibility and content discovery without requiring users to watch the full video.  <br/>
            <br/>
            If the summary has not been generated or the feature is disabled for the requested media, the endpoint returns an error indicating that the summary is unavailable. <br/>

            <summary>
            Get info of media inputs
            
            <remarks>
            This endpoint lets you retrieve detailed information about the media inputs associated with a specific media item. You can use it to verify the media file’s input URL, track its creation status, and check its container format. You must provide the mediaId (either the uploadId or the id) to fetch this information.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### How it works<br/>
            <br/>
            Upon making a `GET` request with the mediaId, FastPix returns a response with: <br/>
            <br/>
            * The public storage input `url` of the uploaded media file. <br/>
            <br/>
            * Information about the media’s video and audio tracks, including whether they were successfully created.<br/>
            <br/>
            * The container format of the uploaded media file (for example, MP4, MKV).<br/>
            <br/>
            This endpoint is particularly useful for ensuring that all necessary tracks (video and audio) have been correctly associated with the media during the upload or media creation process.<br/>

            <br/>
              6. You receive a response containing the list of video views matching the specified criteria.<br/>
            <br/>
            Each view in the response includes a unique `viewId`. You can use this `viewId` with the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get_video_view_details&quot;&gt;Get Video View Details&lt;/a&gt; endpoint to retrieve more detailed information about that specific view.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            #### Example<br/>
